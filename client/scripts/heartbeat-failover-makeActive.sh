echo "Making Active"

# TODO: Replace with commands to make your CNODE active

# Example:
# cp /opt/cardano/cnode/scripts/env-failover/active-env /opt/cardano/cnode/scripts/env
# systemctl restart cnode

# Note: The above example assumes that a copy of env is created in a new directory called env-FAILOVER_SCRIPT_ROOT
# Just copy the original env file to there with the POOL_NAME commented in
